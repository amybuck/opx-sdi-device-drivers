# opx-sdi-device-drivers
This repository contains SDI device drivers for the OPX project. Building this repository results in the creation of the library `libopx_sdi_device_drivers`, used by code in the `opx-sdi-sys` repository. 

Also contained in this repository are the device drivers for various chips used on Dell hardware. The combination of the `opx-sdi-sys`, `opx-sdi-framework` and `opx-sdi-device-drivers` provides a full implementation of the `opx-sdi-api`.
